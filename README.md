# skyjo

Skyjo is a card game and a family fav. Spent 4 hours implementing a game engine that accepts different player agent algo's and lets them compete against each other. Sloppy and fast, but fun.

Very simplistic first pass, with lots of  heuristics missing still not to mention more advanced card counting strategies. But can reliabily win against a random player agent.
